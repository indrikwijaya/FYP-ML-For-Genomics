    Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is fundamental for life. OXPHOS
  complexes pose a unique challenge for the cell, because their subunits are
  encoded on two different genomes, the nuclear genome and the mitochondrial
  genome. Genomic approaches designed to study nuclear/cytosolic and bacterial
  gene expression have not been broadly applied to the mitochondrial system;
  thus the co-regulation of OXPHOS genes remains largely unexplored. Here we
  globally monitored mitochondrial and nuclear gene expression processes in
  Saccharomyces cerevisiae during mitochondrial biogenesis, when OXPHOS
  complexes are synthesized. Nuclear-and mitochondrial-encoded OXPHOS
  transcript levels do not increase concordantly. Instead, we observe that
  mitochondrial and cytosolic translation are rapidly and dynamically regulated
  in a strikingly synchronous fashion. Furthermore, the coordinated translation
  programs are controlled unidirectionally through the intricate and dynamic
  control of cytosolic translation. Thus the nuclear genome carefully directs
  the coordination of mitochondrial and cytosolic translation to orchestrate
  the timely synthesis of each OXPHOS complex, representing an unappreciated
  regulatory layer shaping the mitochondrial proteome. Our whole-cell genomic
  profiling approach establishes a foundation for global gene regulatory
  studies of mitochondrial biology.%

    A system of cluster analysis for genome-wide expression data from DNA
  microarray hybridization is described that uses standard statistical
  algorithms to arrange genes according to similarity in pattern of gene
  expression. The output is displayed graphically, conveying the clustering and
  the underlying expression data simultaneously in a form intuitive for
  biologists. We have found in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that
  clustering gene expression data groups together efficiently genes of known
  similar function, and we find a similar tendency in human data. Thus patterns
  seen in genome-wide expression experiments can be interpreted as indications
  of the status of cellular processes. Also, coexpression of genes of known

  of gaining leads to the functions of many genes for which information is not

    Gaussian mixture models provide an appealing tool for time series

    This article presents a Bayesian method for model-based clustering of gene
  expression dynamics. The method represents gene-expression dynamics as
  autoregressive equations and uses an agglomerative procedure to search for
  the most probable set of clusters given the available data. The main
  contributions of this approach are the ability to take into account the
  dynamic nature of gene expression time series during clustering and a
  principled way to identify the number of distinct clusters. As the number of
  possible clustering models grows exponentially with the number of observed
  time series, we have devised a distance-based heuristic search procedure able
  to render the search process feasible. In this way, the method retains the
  important visualization capability of traditional distance-based clustering
  and acquires an independent, principled measure to decide when two series are
  different enough to belong to different clusters. The reliance of this method
  on an explicit statistical representation of gene expression dynamics makes
  it possible to use standard statistical techniques to assess the goodness of
  fit of the resulting model and validate the underlying assumptions. A set of
  gene-expression time series, collected to study the response of human
  fibroblasts to serum, is used to identify the properties of the method.%

    We present a general algorithm to detect genes differentially expressed
  between two nonhomogeneous time-series data sets. As increasing amounts of
  high-throughput biological data become available, a major challenge in
  genomic and computational biology is to develop methods for comparing data
  from different experimental sources. Time-series whole-genome expression data
  are a particularly valuable source of information because they can describe
  an unfolding biological process such as the cell cycle or immune response.
  However, comparisons of time-series expression data sets are hindered by
  biological and experimental inconsistencies such as differences in sampling
  rate, variations in the timing of biological processes, and the lack of
  repeats. Our algorithm overcomes these difficulties by using a continuous
  representation for time-series data and combining a noise model for
  individual samples with a global difference measure. We introduce a
  corresponding statistical method for computing the significance of this
  differential expression measure. We used our algorithm to compare
  cell-cycle-dependent gene expression in wild-type and knockout yeast strains.
  Our algorithm identified a set of 56 differentially expressed genes, and
  these results were validated by using independent protein-DNA-binding data.
  Unlike previous methods, our algorithm was also able to identify 22
  non-cell-cycle-regulated genes as differentially expressed. This set of genes
  is significantly correlated in a set of independent expression experiments,
  suggesting additional roles for the transcription factors Fkh1 and Fkh2 in
  controlling cellular activity in yeast.%

    This tutorial provides an overview of the basic theory of hidden Markov
  models (HMMs) as originated by L.E. Baum and T. Petrie (1966) and gives
  practical details on methods of implementation of the theory along with a
  description of selected applications of the theory to distinct problems in
  speech recognition. Results from a number of original sources are combined to
  provide a single source of acquiring the background required to pursue
  further this area of research. The author first reviews the theory of
  discrete Markov chains and shows how the concept of hidden states, where the
  observation is a probabilistic function of the state, can be used
  effectively. The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely
  coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental
  problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these
  problems are given. The various types of HMMs that have been studied,
  including ergodic as well as left-right models, are described%

    MOTIVATION: Cellular processes cause changes over time. Observing and
  measuring those changes over time allows insights into the how and why of
  regulation. The experimental platform for doing the appropriate large-scale
  experiments to obtain time-courses of expression levels is provided by
  microarray technology. However, the proper way of analyzing the resulting
  time course data is still very much an issue under investigation. The
  inherent time dependencies in the data suggest that clustering techniques
  which reflect those dependencies yield improved performance. RESULTS: We
  propose to use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to account for the horizontal
  dependencies along the time axis in time course data and to cope with the
  prevalent errors and missing values. The HMMs are used within a model-based
  clustering framework. We are given a number of clusters, each represented by
  one Hidden Markov Model from a finite collection encompassing typical
  qualitative behavior. Then, our method finds in an iterative procedure
  cluster models and an assignment of data points to these models that
  maximizes the joint likelihood of clustering and models. Partially supervised

  clusters--is supported. A graphical user interface allows querying an
  expression profile dataset for time course similar to a prototype graphically
  defined as a sequence of levels and durations. We also propose a heuristic
  approach to automate determination of the number of clusters. We evaluate the
  method on published yeast cell cycle and fibroblasts serum response datasets,
  and compare them, with favorable results, to the autoregressive curves
  method.%

    This paper presents a general framework for time series clus-tering based
  on spectral decomposition of the affinity matrix. We use the Gaussian
  function to construct the affinity matrix and develop a gradient based method
  for self-tuning the variance of the Gaussian function. The feasibility of our
  method is guaranteed by the theoretical inference in this paper. And our
  approach can be used to cluster both constant and variable length time
  series. Further our analysis shows that the cluster number is governed by the
  eigenstructure of the normalized affinity ma-trix. Thus our algorithm is able

    Gene expression over time is, biologically, a continuous process and can
  thus be represented by a continuous function, i.e. a curve. Individual genes
  often share similar expression patterns (functional forms). However, the
  shape of each function, the number of such functions, and the genes that
  share similar functional forms are typically unknown. Here we introduce an
  approach that allows direct discovery of related patterns of gene expression
  and their underlying functions (curves) from data without a priori
  specification of either cluster number or functional form. Smoothing spline
  clustering (SSC) models natural properties of gene expression over time,
  taking into account natural differences in gene expression within a cluster
  of similarly expressed genes, the effects of experimental measurement error,
  and missing data. Furthermore, SSC provides a visual summary of each
  cluster's gene expression function and goodness-of-fit by way of a 'mean
  curve' construct and its associated confidence bands. We apply this method to
  gene expression data over the life-cycle of Drosophila melanogaster and
  Caenorhabditis elegans to discover 17 and 16 unique patterns of gene
  expression in each species, respectively. New and previously described
  expression patterns in both species are discovered, the majority of which are
  biologically meaningful and exhibit statistically significant gene function
  enrichment. Software and source code implementing the algorithm, SSClust, is
  freely available (http://genemerge.bioteam.net/SSClust.html).%

    A large number of longitudinal studies measuring gene expression aim to
  stratify the genes according to their differential temporal behaviors. Genes
  with similar expression patterns may reflect functional responses of

    Time course microarray data provide insight about dynamic biological
  processes. While several clustering methods have been proposed for the
  analysis of these data structures, comparison and selection of appropriate
  clustering methods are seldom discussed. We compared 3 probabilistic based
  clustering methods and 3 distance based clustering methods for time course
  microarray data. Among probabilistic methods, we considered: smoothing spline
  clustering also known as model based functional data analysis (MFDA),
  functional clustering models for sparsely sam-pled data (FCM) and model-based
  clustering (MCLUST). Among distance based methods, we considered: weighted
  gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), clustering with dynamic time
  warping distance (DTW) and clustering with autocorrelation based distance
  (ACF). We studied these algorithms in both simulated settings and case study
  data. Our investigations showed that FCM performed very well when gene curves
  were short and sparse. DTW and WGCNA performed well when gene curves were
  medium or long ({\textgreater}= 10 observations). SSC performed very well
  when there were clusters of gene curves similar to one another. Overall, ACF
  performed poorly in these applications. In terms of computation time, FCM,
  SSC and DTW were considerably slower than MCLUST and WGCNA. WGCNA
  outperformed MCLUST by generating more accurate and biological meaningful
  clustering results. WGCNA and MCLUST are the best methods among the 6 methods
  compared, when performance and computation time are both taken into account.
  WGCNA outperforms MCLUST, but MCLUST provides model based inference and
  uncertainty measure of clustering results. Genome wide microarray data record
  expression levels of thousands genes simultaneously, by measuring the amount
  of cRNA attached to DNA sequence probes on a microarray chip. It has been
  shown that co-regulated genes are also co-expressed [1, 2]. Therefore,
  clustering methods identifying groups of co-expressed genes have proven to be
  powerful tools in the study of genetic functions and biological processes.
  Similarly, DNA methylation microarray analysis measures methylation levels
  for thousands of DNA sequence probes. A gene is methylated when a methyl
  group is attached to its DNA sequence, which, in turn, stops the gene's
  expression and its biological function. Clustering analysis on DNA
  methylation data provides us an opportunity to learn what genes are turned
  off collectively during biological processes. Time course microarray data,
  where gene expression or methylation levels are measured over time, provide a
  good opportunity to understand the dynamics of biological systems and how
  gene activity evolves during biological processes. Genes with similar
  profiles are more likely to be co-regulated or involved in the same
  biological functions. To make full use of time course microarray data, one
  needs to take into account the time sequence and time dependence of
  observations. An important and widely used class of clustering methods is
  distance based clustering. These techniques compute distance measures between
  data points and identify clusters according to partition algorithms. Here, we
  describe several classic examples. In hierarchical clustering, a matrix
  storing Euclidean distances between data points is used as the input to the
  clustering procedure, where close data points form clusters first, and then
  close clusters form bigger clus-ters until there is only one cluster. The
  hierarchical clustering structure can be represented by a dendrogram, a tree
  diagram in which leaves correspond to data points and branches represent
  clusters [3, 1]. In k-means clustering [4, 5], cluster centroid are provided
  as input to the pro-cedure, then the following two steps are repeated
  iteratively, until clustering structure becomes stable: 1. each data point is
  assigned to a cluster whose centroid it is closest to in terms of certain
  distance measure; 2. cluster centroids are computed as the mean of data
  points in each cluster. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA)
  uses a biologically more relevant distance measure in hierarchical clustering
  to form clusters of genes [6, 7]. Specific distance measures can also be
  defined for functional data and used in distance based clustering methods.
  For example, Time warping distances are defined by computing distances
  between time transformation functions that are estimated to model curves'
  transformed time scales in a functional data registration model [8]. An
  alternative approach to data partitioning is model-based or probabilistic
  clustering. These methods assume that data are sampled from a mixture of
  underlying probability dis-tributions [9]. Given the number of clusters,
  parameter estimation is usually carried out by EM algorithm. The number of
  clusters can be determined as a model selection problem via some criteria,
  such as Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Its application to clustering
  gene expression data was first discussed in [10], where a Gaussian mixture
  model was used. Several probabilistic clustering methods have been proposed
  specifically for functional data, 2%

    Control-treatment design is widely used in microarray gene expression
  experiments. The purpose of such a design is to detect genes that express
  differentially between the control and the treatment. Many statistical
  procedures have been developed to detect differentially expressed genes, but
  all have pros and cons and room is still open for improvement. In this study,
  we propose a Bayesian mixture model approach to classifying genes into one of
  three clusters, corresponding to clusters of downregulated, neutral, and
  upregulated genes, respectively. The Bayesian method is implemented via the
  Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. The cluster means of down- and
  upregulated genes are sampled from truncated normal distributions whereas the
  cluster mean of the neutral genes is set to zero. Using simulated data as
  well as data from a real microarray experiment, we demonstrate that the new

    Motivation: Time series expression experiments are used to study a wide
  range of biological systems. More than 80{\%} of all time series expression
  datasets are short (8 time points or fewer). These datasets present unique
  challenges. On account of the large number of genes profiled (often tens of
  thousands) and the small number of time points many patterns are expected to
  arise at random. Most clustering algorithms are unable to distinguish between
  real and random patterns. Results: We present an algorithm specifically
  designed for clustering short time series expression data. Our algorithm
  works by assigning genes to a predefined set of model pro-files that capture
  the potential distinct patterns that can be expected from the experiment. We
  discuss how to obtain such a set of profiles and how to determine the
  significance of each of these profiles. Significant profiles are retained for
  further analysis and can be combined to form clusters. We tested our method
  on both simulated and real biological data. Using immune response data we
  show that our algorithm can correctly detect the temporal profile of relevant
  functional categories. Using Gene Ontology analysis we show that our
  algorithm outperforms both general clustering algorithms and algorithms
  designed specifically for clustering time series gene expression data.

    The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the
  last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the
  underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have
  grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models
  have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic
  techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly
  enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms
  such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based
  on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications.
  This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while
  providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition
  and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year
  PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge
  of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity
  with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some
  experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential
  as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability
  theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics,
  computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and
  bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors,
  including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example
  solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site,
  while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the
  publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and
  the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest
  information. Christopher M. Bishop is Deputy Director of Microsoft Research
  Cambridge, and holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of
  Edinburgh. He is a Fellow of Darwin College Cambridge, a Fellow of the Royal
  Academy of Engineering, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His
  previous textbook "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" has been widely
  adopted.%

    In this paper it is shown that the classical maximum likelihood principle
  can be considered to be a method of asymptotic realization of an optimum
  estimate with respect to a very general information theoretic criterion. This
  observation shows an extension of the principle to provide answers to many
  practical problems of statistical model fitting.%

    We propose a method (the â€˜gap statistic') for estimating the number of
  clusters (groups) in a set of data. The technique uses the output of any
  clustering algorithm (e.g. K-means or hierarchical), comparing the change in
  within-cluster dispersion with that expected under an appropriate reference
  null distribution. Some theory is developed for the proposal and a simulation
  study shows that the gap statistic usually outperforms other methods that
  have been proposed in the literature.%

    MOTIVATION: The precise dynamics of gene expression is often crucial for
  proper response to stimuli. Time-course gene-expression profiles can provide
  insights about the dynamics of many cellular responses, but are often noisy
  and measured at arbitrary intervals, posing a major analysis challenge.
  RESULTS: We developed an algorithm that interleaves clustering time-course
  gene-expression data with estimation of dynamic models of their response by
  biologically meaningful parameters. In combining these two tasks we overcome
  obstacles posed in each one. Moreover, our approach provides an easy way to
  compare between responses to different stimuli at the dynamical level. We use
  our approach to analyze the dynamical transcriptional responses to
  inflammation and anti-viral stimuli in mice primary dendritic cells, and
  extract a concise representation of the different dynamical response types.
  We analyze the similarities and differences between the two stimuli and
  identify potential regulators of this complex transcriptional response.

    The k-means method is a widely used clustering technique that seeks to
  minimize the average squared distance between points in the same cluster.
  Although it offers no accuracy guarantees, its simplicity and speed are very
  appealing in practice. By augmenting k-means with a very simple, randomized
  seeding technique, we obtain an algorithm that is $\Theta$(logk)-competitive
  with the optimal clustering. Preliminary experiments show that our
  augmentation improves both the speed and the accuracy of k-means, often quite
  dramatically.%
