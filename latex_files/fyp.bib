The method represents gene-expression dynamics as autoregressive equations and uses an agglomerative procedure to search for the most probable set of clusters given the available data. The main contributions of this approach are the ability to take into account the dynamic nature of gene expression time series during clustering and a principled way to identify the number of distinct clusters. As the number of possible clustering models grows exponentially with the number of observed time series, we have devised a distance-based heuristic search procedure able to render the search process feasible. In this way, the method retains the important visualization capability of traditional distance-based clustering and acquires an independent, principled measure to decide when two series are different enough to belong to different clusters. The reliance of this method on an explicit statistical representation of gene expression dynamics makes it possible to use standard statistical techniques to assess the goodness of fit of the resulting model and validate the underlying assumptions. A set of gene-expression time series, collected to study the response of human fibroblasts to serum, is used to identify the properties of the method.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Cellular processes cause changes over time. Observing and measuring those changes over time allows insights into the how and why of regulation. The experimental platform for doing the appropriate large-scale experiments to obtain time-courses of expression levels is provided by microarray technology. However, the proper way of analyzing the resulting time course data is still very much an issue under investigation. The inherent time dependencies in the data suggest that clustering techniques which reflect those dependencies yield improved performance. RESULTS: We propose to use Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) to account for the horizontal dependencies along the time axis in time course data and to cope with the prevalent errors and missing values. The HMMs are used within a model-based clustering framework. We are given a number of clusters, each represented by one Hidden Markov Model from a finite collection encompassing typical qualitative behavior. Then, our method finds in an iterative procedure cluster models and an assignment of data points to these models that maximizes the joint likelihood of clustering and models. Partially supervised learning--adding groups of labeled data to the initial collection of clusters--is supported. A graphical user interface allows querying an expression profile dataset for time course similar to a prototype graphically defined as a sequence of levels and durations. We also propose a heuristic approach to automate determination of the number of clusters. We evaluate the method on published yeast cell cycle and fibroblasts serum response datasets, and compare them, with favorable results, to the autoregressive curves method.},

abstract = {Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) is fundamental for life. OXPHOS complexes pose a unique challenge for the cell, because their subunits are encoded on two different genomes, the nuclear genome and the mitochondrial genome. Genomic approaches designed to study nuclear/cytosolic and bacterial gene expression have not been broadly applied to the mitochondrial system; thus the co-regulation of OXPHOS genes remains largely unexplored. Here we globally monitored mitochondrial and nuclear gene expression processes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae during mitochondrial biogenesis, when OXPHOS complexes are synthesized. Nuclear-and mitochondrial-encoded OXPHOS transcript levels do not increase concordantly. Instead, we observe that mitochondrial and cytosolic translation are rapidly and dynamically regulated in a strikingly synchronous fashion. Furthermore, the coordinated translation programs are controlled unidirectionally through the intricate and dynamic control of cytosolic translation. Thus the nuclear genome carefully directs the coordination of mitochondrial and cytosolic translation to orchestrate the timely synthesis of each OXPHOS complex, representing an unappreciated regulatory layer shaping the mitochondrial proteome. Our whole-cell genomic profiling approach establishes a foundation for global gene regulatory studies of mitochondrial biology.},

Time-course gene-expression profiles can provide insights about the dynamics of many cellular responses, but are often noisy and measured at arbitrary intervals, posing a major analysis challenge. RESULTS: We developed an algorithm that interleaves clustering time-course gene-expression data with estimation of dynamic models of their response by biologically meaningful parameters. In combining these two tasks we overcome obstacles posed in each one. Moreover, our approach provides an easy way to compare between responses to different stimuli at the dynamical level. We use our approach to analyze the dynamical transcriptional responses to inflammation and anti-viral stimuli in mice primary dendritic cells, and extract a concise representation of the different dynamical response types. We analyze the similarities and differences between the two stimuli and identify potential regulators of this complex transcriptional response.

abstract = {The dramatic growth in practical applications for machine learning over the last ten years has been accompanied by many important developments in the underlying algorithms and techniques. For example, Bayesian methods have grown from a specialist niche to become mainstream, while graphical models have emerged as a general framework for describing and applying probabilistic techniques. The practical applicability of Bayesian methods has been greatly enhanced by the development of a range of approximate inference algorithms such as variational Bayes and expectation propagation, while new models based on kernels have had a significant impact on both algorithms and applications. This completely new textbook reflects these recent developments while providing a comprehensive introduction to the fields of pattern recognition and machine learning. It is aimed at advanced undergraduates or first-year PhD students, as well as researchers and practitioners. No previous knowledge of pattern recognition or machine learning concepts is assumed. Familiarity with multivariate calculus and basic linear algebra is required, and some experience in the use of probabilities would be helpful though not essential as the book includes a self-contained introduction to basic probability theory. The book is suitable for courses on machine learning, statistics, computer science, signal processing, computer vision, data mining, and bioinformatics. Extensive support is provided for course instructors, including more than 400 exercises, graded according to difficulty. Example solutions for a subset of the exercises are available from the book web site, while solutions for the remainder can be obtained by instructors from the publisher. The book is supported by a great deal of additional material, and the reader is encouraged to visit the book web site for the latest information. Christopher M. Bishop is Deputy Director of Microsoft Research Cambridge, and holds a Chair in Computer Science at the University of Edinburgh.

The purpose of such a design is to detect genes that express differentially between the control and the treatment. Many statistical procedures have been developed to detect differentially expressed genes, but all have pros and cons and room is still open for improvement. In this study, we propose a Bayesian mixture model approach to classifying genes into one of three clusters, corresponding to clusters of downregulated, neutral, and upregulated genes, respectively. The Bayesian method is implemented via the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. The cluster means of down- and upregulated genes are sampled from truncated normal distributions whereas the cluster mean of the neutral genes is set to zero. Using simulated data as well as data from a real microarray experiment, we demonstrate that the new method outperforms all methods commonly used in differential expression analysis.},

The theory is illustrated with two simple examples, namely coin-tossing, and the classic balls-in-urns system. Three fundamental problems of HMMs are noted and several practical techniques for solving these problems are given.

	abstract = {We present a general algorithm to detect genes differentially expressed between two nonhomogeneous time-series data sets. As increasing amounts of high-throughput biological data become available, a major challenge in genomic and computational biology is to develop methods for comparing data from different experimental sources. Time-series whole-genome expression data are a particularly valuable source of information because they can describe an unfolding biological process such as the cell cycle or immune response. However, comparisons of time-series expression data sets are hindered by biological and experimental inconsistencies such as differences in sampling rate, variations in the timing of biological processes, and the lack of repeats. Our algorithm overcomes these difficulties by using a continuous representation for time-series data and combining a noise model for individual samples with a global difference measure. We introduce a corresponding statistical method for computing the significance of this differential expression measure. We used our algorithm to compare cell-cycle-dependent gene expression in wild-type and knockout yeast strains. Our algorithm identified a set of 56 differentially expressed genes, and these results were validated by using independent protein-DNA-binding data. Unlike previous methods, our algorithm was also able to identify 22 non-cell-cycle-regulated genes as differentially expressed. This set of genes is significantly correlated in a set of independent expression experiments, suggesting additional roles for the transcription factors Fkh1 and Fkh2 in controlling cellular activity in yeast.},

abstract = {Gene expression over time is, biologically, a continuous process and can thus be represented by a continuous function, i.e. a curve. Individual genes often share similar expression patterns (functional forms). However, the shape of each function, the number of such functions, and the genes that share similar functional forms are typically unknown. Here we introduce an approach that allows direct discovery of related patterns of gene expression and their underlying functions (curves) from data without a priori specification of either cluster number or functional form. Smoothing spline clustering (SSC) models natural properties of gene expression over time, taking into account natural differences in gene expression within a cluster of similarly expressed genes, the effects of experimental measurement error, and missing data. Furthermore, SSC provides a visual summary of each cluster's gene expression function and goodness-of-fit by way of a 'mean curve' construct and its associated confidence bands. We apply this method to gene expression data over the life-cycle of Drosophila melanogaster and Caenorhabditis elegans to discover 17 and 16 unique patterns of gene expression in each species, respectively. New and previously described expression patterns in both species are discovered, the majority of which are biologically meaningful and exhibit statistically significant gene function enrichment. Software and source code implementing the algorithm, SSClust, is freely available (http://genemerge.bioteam.net/SSClust.html).},

An original postprandial fasting experiment was conducted in the mouse and the expression of 200 genes was monitored with a dedicated macroarray at 11 time points between 0 and 72 hours of fasting. The aim of this study was to provide a relevant clustering of gene expression temporal profiles. This was achieved by focusing on the shapes of the curves rather than on the absolute level of expression. Actually, we combined spline smoothing and first derivative computation with hierarchical and partitioning clustering. A heuristic approach was proposed to tune the spline smoothing parameter using both statistical and biological considerations. Clusters are illustrated a posteriori through principal component analysis and heatmap visualization. Most results were found to be in agreement with the literature on the effects of fasting on the mouse liver and provide promising directions for future biological investigations.},

These problems are common for example when applying GP models independently to each gene in a gene expression time series data set. Such sets typically contain very few time points and hence naive application of common GP modelling techniques can lead to severe over-fitting in a significant fraction of the fitted models, depending on the details of the data set. We propose avoiding over-fitting by constrain-ing the GP length-scale to values that are compatible with the spacing of the time points. We demonstrate that this eliminates otherwise serious over-fitting in real experiment using GP model to rank single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on their likelihood of being under natural selection.},

abstract = {Motivation: Time series expression experiments are used to study a wide range of biological systems. More than 80{\%} of all time series expression datasets are short (8 time points or fewer). These datasets present unique challenges. On account of the large number of genes profiled (often tens of thousands) and the small number of time points many patterns are expected to arise at random. Most clustering algorithms are unable to distinguish between real and random patterns. Results: We present an algorithm specifically designed for clustering short time series expression data. Our algorithm works by assigning genes to a predefined set of model pro-files that capture the potential distinct patterns that can be expected from the experiment. We discuss how to obtain such a set of profiles and how to determine the significance of each of these profiles. Significant profiles are retained for further analysis and can be combined to form clusters. We tested our method on both simulated and real biological data. Using immune response data we show that our algorithm can correctly detect the temporal profile of relevant functional categories. Using Gene Ontology analysis we show that our algorithm outperforms both general clustering algorithms and algorithms designed specifically for clustering time series gene expression data.

abstract = {Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) causes the highest number of deaths from cancer in children aged between one and fourteen. The most common treatment for children with ALL is chemotherapy, a cancer treatment that uses drugs to kill cancer cells or stop cell division. The drug and dosage combinations may vary for each child. Unfortunately, chemotherapy treatments may cause serious side effects. Glucocorticoids (GCs) have been used as therapeutic agents for children with ALL for more than 50 years. Common and widely drugs in this class include prednisolone and dexamethasone. Childhood leukemia now has a survival rate of 80{\%} (Pui, Robison, {\&} Look, 2008). The key clinical question is identifying those children who will not respond well to established therapy strategies. GCs regulate diverse biological processes, for example, metabolism, development, differentiation, cell survival and immunity. GCs induce apoptosis and G1 cell cycle arrest in lymphoid cells. In fact, not much is known about the molecular mechanism of GCs sensitivity and resistance, and GCs-induced apoptotic signal transduction pathways and there are many controversial hypotheses about both genes regulated by GCs and potential molecular mechanism of GCs-induced apoptosis. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of this drug should lead to better prognostic factors (treatment response), more targeted therapies and prevention of side effects. GCs induced apoptosis have been studied by using microarray technology in vivo and in vitro on samples consisting of GCs treated ALL cell lines, mouse thymocytes and/or ALL patients. However, time series GCs treated childhood ALL datasets are currently extremely limited. DNA microarrays are essential tools for analysis of expression of many genes simultaneously. Gene expression data show the level of activity of several genes under experimental conditions. Genes with similar expression patterns could belong to the same pathway or have similar function. DNA microarray data analysis has been carried out using statistical analysis as well as machine learning and data mining approaches. There are many microarray analysis tools; this study aims to combine emergent clustering methods to get meaningful biological insights into mechanisms underlying GCs induced apoptosis. In this study, microarray data originated from prednisolone (glucocorticoids) treated childhood ALL samples (Schmidt et al., 2006) (B-linage and T-linage) and collected at 6 and 24 hours after treatment are analysed using four methods: Self-organizing maps (SOMs), Emergent self-organizing maps (ESOM) (Ultsch {\&} Morchen, 2005), the Short Time series Expression Miner (STEM) (Ernst {\&} Bar-Joseph, 2006) and Fuzzy clustering by Local Approximation of MEmbership (FLAME) (Fu {\&} Medico, 2007). The results revealed intrinsic biological patterns underlying the GCs time series data: there are at least five different gene activities happening during the three time points; GCs-induced apoptotic genes were identified; and genes active at both time points or only at 6 hours or 24 hours were determined. Also, interesting gene clusters with membership in already known pathways were found thereby providing promising candidate gens for further inferring GCs induced apoptotic gene regulatory networks.},

@article{Zhang2014,
abstract = {Time course microarray data provide insight about dynamic biological processes. While several clustering methods have been proposed for the analysis of these data structures, comparison and selection of appropriate clustering methods are seldom discussed. We compared 3 probabilistic based clustering methods and 3 distance based clustering methods for time course microarray data. Among probabilistic methods, we considered: smoothing spline clustering also known as model based functional data analysis (MFDA), functional clustering models for sparsely sam-pled data (FCM) and model-based clustering (MCLUST). Among distance based methods, we considered: weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), clustering with dynamic time warping distance (DTW) and clustering with autocorrelation based distance (ACF). We studied these algorithms in both simulated settings and case study data. Our investigations showed that FCM performed very well when gene curves were short and sparse. DTW and WGCNA performed well when gene curves were medium or long ({\textgreater}= 10 observations). SSC performed very well when there were clusters of gene curves similar to one another. Overall, ACF performed poorly in these applications. In terms of computation time, FCM, SSC and DTW were considerably slower than MCLUST and WGCNA. WGCNA outperformed MCLUST by generating more accurate and biological meaningful clustering results. WGCNA and MCLUST are the best methods among the 6 methods compared, when performance and computation time are both taken into account. WGCNA outperforms MCLUST, but MCLUST provides model based inference and uncertainty measure of clustering results. Genome wide microarray data record expression levels of thousands genes simultaneously, by measuring the amount of cRNA attached to DNA sequence probes on a microarray chip. It has been shown that co-regulated genes are also co-expressed [1, 2]. Therefore, clustering methods identifying groups of co-expressed genes have proven to be powerful tools in the study of genetic functions and biological processes. Similarly, DNA methylation microarray analysis measures methylation levels for thousands of DNA sequence probes. A gene is methylated when a methyl group is attached to its DNA sequence, which, in turn, stops the gene's expression and its biological function. Clustering analysis on DNA methylation data provides us an opportunity to learn what genes are turned off collectively during biological processes. Time course microarray data, where gene expression or methylation levels are measured over time, provide a good opportunity to understand the dynamics of biological systems and how gene activity evolves during biological processes. Genes with similar profiles are more likely to be co-regulated or involved in the same biological functions. To make full use of time course microarray data, one needs to take into account the time sequence and time dependence of observations. An important and widely used class of clustering methods is distance based clustering. These techniques compute distance measures between data points and identify clusters according to partition algorithms. Here, we describe several classic examples. In hierarchical clustering, a matrix storing Euclidean distances between data points is used as the input to the clustering procedure, where close data points form clusters first, and then close clusters form bigger clus-ters until there is only one cluster. The hierarchical clustering structure can be represented by a dendrogram, a tree diagram in which leaves correspond to data points and branches represent clusters [3, 1]. In k-means clustering [4, 5], cluster centroid are provided as input to the pro-cedure, then the following two steps are repeated iteratively, until clustering structure becomes stable: 1. each data point is assigned to a cluster whose centroid it is closest to in terms of certain distance measure; 2. cluster centroids are computed as the mean of data points in each cluster. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) uses a biologically more relevant distance measure in hierarchical clustering to form clusters of genes [6, 7]. Specific distance measures can also be defined for functional data and used in distance based clustering methods. For example, Time warping distances are defined by computing distances between time transformation functions that are estimated to model curves' transformed time scales in a functional data registration model [8]. An alternative approach to data partitioning is model-based or probabilistic clustering. These methods assume that data are sampled from a mixture of underlying probability dis-tributions [9]. Given the number of clusters, parameter estimation is usually carried out by EM algorithm. The number of clusters can be determined as a model selection problem via some criteria, such as Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Its application to clustering gene expression data was first discussed in [10], where a Gaussian mixture model was used. Several probabilistic clustering methods have been proposed specifically for functional data, 2},
