abstract = {Machine learning methods are becoming increasingly important in the analysis of large-scale genomic, epigenomic, proteomic and metabolic data sets. In this Review, the authors consider the applications of supervised, semi-supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods to genetic and genomic studies. They provide general guidelines for the selection and application of algorithms that are best suited to particular study designs.},
